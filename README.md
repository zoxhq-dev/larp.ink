## The updated source code repo for larp.ink

### Terrible devs
#### All of the code and design/format of this website looks like AI wrote it.
#### The "Developers" have huge mental issues and big egos. They also stay on discord 24/7 and still dont focus their time into developing without AI.
#### This repo wont be updated often. I just did this as a joke to piss of the script kiddies who own this website lol

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/derealizations/larpink.git
